for Individuals:

Most poeple are human, kind, and will probably be incredibly close friends given the time investment. But meeting new poeple is often difficult. 

There are depths to humans and way we've somehow socially agreed to meet someone is 


1. excahnge names
2. where are you from? what major are you? where do you work?

these questions can work as a way to introduce each other but how do you get from someone youve met to the close freind you can think through diffuclt decisions with or share your most exciting wins with incredilby ease and comfort? 

For companies:
compaines want to hire incredibly skilled people who work well on teams and fit hteir company culture. 
to companies where culture matters they invest a lot of resoruces into builidn their brand image to attract the most relevant types of people. and cutlutre fit is imporat for company sucess. 

culture is the unwritten rues of what is rewarded and what is expected. the nuance how how poeple are expected to communicate, and priortize under unceratinity, constraints, stress.

leetcode style questions are quite ineffecetive at assessing somones ability to perfom well ont he job. but companies sitll use it as a proxy for their exposure to the filed and if anythin it tests their ability to learn a specific thing. They get a bad rap for not being reflective of the job. 


so when hiring somone or making friends and choosign to ivest time and resources inot a relationship/freindship withsome wthere is often a trial period wher eover a period fo time you encournter different senarios wand make observations of how someone responds to various secnairons. good news, bad dnews, how they communciate when incentives are alinged or misaligned, what priorities they choose. 


=========
A proxy for easily building comfort, skipping the small talk, and building trust I have found is the use of obardgames. 

video games could also have a similar argument, however in this case I have more experience iwht board games and you hav ethe infperson interaction of body language, voice tone, and other observations

board games are a safe place to experess how you are becasue as a group you all suspend disbeilf and enter a collective shared world with agreed upon rules with simulated stakes and dyanimcs. 

if you disagree on rules you also get to see how people respond to disagree ments, if they box you out, if they go quiete, get angry



of these I have found Blood on the clocktower to be an effective game that is condusive for understanding how poeple make decisions under uncerainity than other games. 


it is a social dedcution game that simulates highs stakes and places players in a unceratin enviornment

it is like mafia/town of salem or any of those games where you have a group of people each with their own role and ability/mechannism to recive information and a group of antaognists that can eliminte players

split into "day" and "night" phases and complex incentives and dyanmics 
where it is diffult to verify truth of nay information and synethiss multiple sources becasue you do not know who you can trust. so over time you have to be able to convince others of your trust worthiness, validate other's information 

trains ability to make decisions, good judgement



often in dating or knowing someone new poele say the "90 day rule" of the true colors of someone comes out after thrre montsh becasue beyond its osme threshold wehre it is diffcult to maintain a facade for extended periods of times.
this can be true if you see them semi frequently across the three moths, that as more time you invest the more obersvations you have to build a model of them 


board games can short cut to a place were youc an assess those with little small talk. 

you get more of who they are easier
reduces the action potential 




Spring 2025 I played a social deduction board game twice a week for 15 weeks. 
I made incredibly meainful connections i a short period of time. 

when i first go tot college i thought a lot about how we meet poeple and make freinds
and in internships it can be challenging to make freinds and build a community especially if there are a lot of interns and you ony see them once every two weeks for a group dinner. 
people enjoy meainful conversation but being vunderable is sacry. 
i had a group of iitners right after my psring summer where one of them said " alright weve met each other, whats your darkest secert?"
or " what are you most afraid of"
and while these conversation are meanifnul and can lead to a better understanign of you and the world aroudn you and build bonds
they have a prerequesit that the poeple you are engaging in conversation with are people who are trustowthy to be consdierate, thoughtful, and algined with your intersts. 



=========================

Blood on the Clocktower is one of my favorite ways to build strong connections with peopleand surprisingly effective


it is a social dedcution game that simulates highs stakes and places players in a unceratin enviornment


- how do you build trust in an enviornment where information is hardly verifyable

you can clearly assess how people communicate under stress and uncertainity 


a lot of board games are simulations of the things that we encoutner in life and companes but nothing has been so effectivle been able to caputre so simply the complex dyanmics of life in an essay way. 

its hard to be someone else in a board game
