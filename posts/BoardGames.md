Blood on the Clocktower is one of my favorite ways to build strong connections with people
and surprisingly effective


it is a social dedcution game that simulates highs stakes and places players in a unceratin enviornment


- how do you build trust in an enviornment where information is hardly verifyable

you can clearly assess how people communicate under stress and uncertainity 


a lot of board games are simulations of the things that we encoutner in life and companes but nothing has been so effectivle been able to caputre so simply the complex dyanmics of life in an essay way. 

its hard to be someone else in a board game
