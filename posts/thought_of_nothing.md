Hello? Are you there?
Ah, I thought you might finally come see me. Here, sit with me. 

Anything you wanted to say?
No.
Questions?
None.
Thoughts?
Not really.
hmmmm.







	Have you ever smelt a rose?
	Yes.
	Remember what it was like?
	Mhmmm

	No.









It's rather quiet.
It is. 
Why don't you say something?
Your mind is racing. Your heart is aching. You are in turmoil, my friend.
How about you tell me a story?
A story? 
Yes a really nice one. With joy and love and triumph. 
I have none. 
Or maybe one with a puppy. 
You're the one with a life’s worth of experiences. 
Then anything, 


but just fill this silence. 


















Not a story then. No introduction. No characters. No plot. No setting. No lesson. Just me. And you. And this wall. Blank. Empty. Imperfect. Just like us. 
It has dimples along its length. Bumps. Ups and downs. Light and dark. Put there by time. Put there by adversity. Put there by experience. Just like us
It's got charm. But alas, a singular wall too gets lonely sometimes. So with structures like its own, it makes up the space, my home: the box. Oh, you have never been in a place like that. Too strange. Too frightening. Too much nothing. You wouldn't like it, at least not in your current state of mind. 
I could describe it to you all day: the mystery, the fascination, the lure. But you’d probably walk away before I even started. You are all funny that way. Lavish, careless, and fast. Always seeking information, constant augmentation, mental simulation. Intoxicated on the mirage of knowledge. But who am I to judge, I don't even know when I was born. Ever since I became one, all I knew was the box. It's not much really. It's always well lit but not too harsh. Just enough to keep you safe but never interesting enough to distract you. Days, years, centuries. I don’t know the difference. But you might be able to tell if you were in the box. Would you be able to sit with me sometime? In the box, in complete silence? 
That's easy for me to ask. I'm not like you. Not dragged down by mortality.
Who are you?
I've never thought about that.
Never?
 There is no other. Just me. I suppose it never really occurred to me. I didn't feel any different from anything else. There was nothing to feel different from. 

What about you? What would you do if you were in a box like that?
I suppose you do need to satiate your primal motivators: hunger, rest, waste, and morality, and motivation. But what if you don't need to do those things. Would you just become like me? Or would you still be you? Liberated from limitation or robbed of motivation? 

I like you. You make me think. 

It's nice sometimes, to think about being. 







It's confusing. And endless. And overwhelming. Sometimes I wish I could run away.

and hide. 




Isn't it amusing? 
Hmm?
You want to be at peace, with no distractions, nothing to worry you. I suppose, a bit like me. But I want to be like you. To move around. To be curious and courageous and creative. To be alive and to wonder. Both of us want what the other has. Sure I may sound so wise but I too am just you. Call it what you will. But in the end, we all just want serenity. Are we all not parts of something greater?
Yes. but it’s impossible. Just an ideal idea to institute inspiration.
It is impossible.


It is impossible when we live in the past, thinking about all the things we have done, the things we could have done, the things we should have done. Thinking about the things we didn't do, the time we carelessly spew. The times we didn't wake up to the morning dew, the time we stayed up past due. What more could we possibly do?
People we talked to, people we hurt, and the people we held on to. 
We hold on. We hold on to the people we thought dear. We hold on to the past from fear. We hold on to our paradigms.Reciprocate to regurgitated reminders of regret and reasonable repulsion. 
We drown when we dwell on the past.
 
It is impossible when we live in the future. Live in the faintly plausible, entertain the improbable, anticipate the least favorable. We know not of what is yet to come, we do not act on what we know now. Thinking about things we won't get to do, the time forecast blue. 
The times we will come upon diverging paths, the times we will incur fate’s fatal wrath. The things we won't see, the things we don't need. What if I choose the wrong path? What if it is too late. That I have already chosen and walked to the path’s end? 
We drown when we dwell on the future. 






I like the way you speak.




I was thinking not moments before and already I see the mental hole it tore. 
Are you going to continue rhyming?
Maybe. 







I thought it was charming.
Mmhmm. 
Maybe a story would have been better after all. 




The possibilities, truly, are endless. I see why you are so passionate about pursuing each and everyone to exhaustion. But don't you think it's a bit too … pointless?
Perhaps but like you, it is what I was given.
We know that everything will come to an end. 

So why is it so hard to not chase the thoughts? To simplify let them flow but not let them affect you? To entertain a thought without it corrupting you. Like a rose and rain, interacting but all in vain, never in union. We have been afraid to be alone with our mind, to simply think than distract, produce than consume.
	

	When was the last time you thought about breathing. Mindful of the worldly tether, of which you may hold in strife, grounding you to this life, keep you from disappearing into the ether? You writhe in pain and seek the sickening pleasure. To think of all the things that must have happened to bring you here. A statistical anomaly. Insignificant in the vast unrelenting universe. 
I am grateful for you. We are but fleeting moments of time which became conscious to simply realize that the story was not about us. Given enough time to be grateful and to fade into forever once more. 

If you feel lonely, remember me. 
Remember the blank wall. And most of all remember our little talks. 

From time to time, stop and smell the roses for me.
	Mhmm









I'll be here. 










Waiting…
