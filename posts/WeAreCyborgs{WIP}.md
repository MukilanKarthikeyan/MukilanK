I lost 481 contacts


The part of me that remebers the names the interactions and face remains. the part of me that rembers phone numbers, emails, birthdays of friends, family, and aquaintances has left an empty gap.

This valentines day I woke up to see that I had lost all of the contacts from the past 6 years of my life.




your memories: $5.99 /month forever




how much of me is no longer only stored on my personal phsycial being?
outsorucing memeris is nothign new, we have been usign cave walls and paper and even minds of others to help us remember things, 
we exetenrial information inot a more peermante staten than our own intenral consiousness andd membery 
this is like our long term member as oppposed to our ram

the difference now is that it has becing easier to produce more data 

in the past you had to sit down and medate on t yoru tohtos and write them down on parchemtn and, paper, or chisel them
which meant thath you had to think abou tit, and each word would take a logn time
to capture the realsimo fthe worl aroudn you had to paint over months,

the higher action potnetial meant that the things we chose to store had more meaning to them. they were intnetional 

now this is were we get "AI slop" that the requriment for creation is small that we can create anything, we dont have to wait for something to be meaninful and worth the cost incursed to create becasue the cost is so miniaml

if it takes 10 weeks to create each art work while many good ideas may be left on the table, you can be sure tha twhen you interact with it that someone out there truly belived that the work was worth the effort enough to makde it. now if it takes you 10 seconds, you no longer have that information that thsi is someting meaniful where the author was trying to intential communiacte something of value rather than something that was a passing thought 


the burden of evaluation and validation has shifted from the creator to the viewer. 
not all the way of coruse, but the threshold has lowers/ 

that is why there will alaways be value in human made artisinal work. 

we use mass manufatured plates and bowls becaue it is functional and it makes not much difference. but we gift our loved ones hand made plate and bowls and mugs we made on a real pottery wheel not because they are better but becasue they are a symbol of the cost incurred towards an act that was deemd important. 

the cost is the value*

I could imagine a world where all functional work will be automated 
all meaniful work will be human made. 



============
blog format: a timeline? 
paitning, cameras, ditigal coameras? 
it becaem quicker and aeasier and more convenient to create higher quility images of our world faster

analog media

you do not need to brainwash poeple for them to hand over their freedoms.
you simply have to offer them the promise of conviencne. 

I am missing analog media:
where ther are phsyical copies int he owrld that I understrand teh internal dyanmics of
the digitial sytems have changes that take time to track
